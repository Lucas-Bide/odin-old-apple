This [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients) concerns recreating the Apple homepage from 2014. The focus is on using background images and gradients for elements. It also serves as practice for positioning techniques.
I'll also make an effort of appropriately using the Git commit command, since I've used it sparsely, usually to "initialize" and "finish" the project.
